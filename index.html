        <h3>Human Function Learning in Varying Modalities</h3>
        <p>My masters' research project was concerned with a cognitive science question: the exploration of the effect that
          data availability (memory) has on human function learning and the resulting extrapolation patterns. It involved
          the development of a Javascript-based application and its deployment as as an experimental tool to collect participant
          responses. The collected data was then analysed and we found that a simple memory-limited Bayesian model is consistent
          with human extrapolations for linear data.</p>

        <h3>Women in Data Science Datathon</h3>
        <p>I put together a team and took part in an online datathon organised as part of the 'Women in Data Science' conference.
          The datathon was hosted on Kaggle and involved analysing a dataset which contained demographic and behavioural information
          about a sample of survey respondents from India and their usage of financial services. The challenge was to predict
          the gender of each respondent. To do this, we were encouraged to explore the key differences in behaviour patterns
          between men and women, and how it may impact their use of these services. We built a machine learning model and managed
          to achieve 88% accuracy.

        <p> The Center for Copyright Research of the University of Glasgow organised a hackathon centered around law and copyright
          themes. My team and I won the competition by constructing an automated system of gathering and examining evidence
          of how copyright protection (high or low) can impact creative production in the video game industry, using text
          mining and data analysis on a large corpus of creative goods found on online marketplaces.</p>

        <h3>Analysing the Interplay between Students' Academic Preferences and Sociological Variables</h3>
        <p>
          For my fifth year's research project I implemented algorithms that use statistical methods (Hidden Markov Models) for the
          analysis of the profiles and level of engagement of prospective students that participated in Open Days. The data on
          which the analysis was made was obtained from a mobile app designed by the company Bizvento. that can help researchers
          answer larger questions concerning the link between students' sociological profiles and their academic interests.

        leaking of personal information. I developed a web application that revealed users' level of exposure on Facebook. Users
        could log in using their Facebook account and find out what potentially sensitive information is public on the platform and
        what they can do to protect themselves.</p>

        of their travels by car, bus, train or plane. It used the Google Maps API and functioned as a directions tool while also
        offering information relating to the environmental cost. The information on environmental effects was obtained as part of
        the open data framework provided by the Scottish Government. The app won one of two prizes offered by the Rewired Glasgow
        team.

          Mobile Human Computer Interaction. We built a minimalist anti-distraction app for smart watches, that allows a user to 
          keep track of tasks and time spent on them in a simple and reliable way. This app provides the user with the ability 
          to set up tasks, time them, get reminded about them and also be able to track their progress.
